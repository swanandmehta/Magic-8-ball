Today is 11 Nov 23 Morning/Afternoon my big plans to work on BD pipeline are in ruin :(

since somewhere some dumb person revoked my access to AWS lab now I have nothing to do
I thought of going for netflix and chill without the chill part.... ya its been while :(
and between watching Enola homes 2 and drinking couple of beers i thought of 
what the fuck am I doing with my life ? among other things.... I am hinting at one specific person you know who you are

so as normal person i went on internet or freaking rabit hole to look for answer and guess who i end up asking to ?
you guessed it...... freaking magic 8 ball

I have some stuff pending but I dont wanna do work so this is the thing so I am making this.
Now I am gonna make a game out of it everytime i complete step I am gonna drink.

YOU MAY NOT ASK WHY THE FUCK I AM DEPLOYING BE SERVER WHEN IT COULD BE DONE USING ONLY FE STACK... YES I KNOW IT CAN BE DONE ON FE 
I KNOW I DONT NEED TO USE SPRING, ANGULAR AND WHATEVER THIS IS MY PROJECT AND YOU CAN KINDLY FUCK OFF

The only reason i am writing this code so i could have my sanity back atleast for next few hours
Once I sober up I will come back to "What the fuck am i doing with my life question"
